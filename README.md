# BREAST-CANCER-PROGNOSIS-AND-PREDICTIONS-ANALYSIS-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-APPLICATIONS
At present breast cancer became most common cancer among women . With the early diagnosis of breast cancer survival of the patient will increase from 56% to more than 86%. The main purpose of our study is to know how machine learning algorithms are applicable to predict Breast cancer. Our findings show that machine learning can play  an important role in investigations, prediction, and  diagnosis of breast cancer.Different algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors(KNN),support vector machine (SVM),Logistic-regression are performed. In conclusion, machine learning can be used in healthcare programs and plans to evaluate and prioritize cases of breast cancer. In an examination of many models, Logistic Regression performed better than all other supervised learning techniques in terms of accuracy.

On the dataset for breast cancer that was taken into consideration, all the models provided accuracy of more than 90%, however LOGISTIC REGRESSION had the greatest accuracy of 97.07%. According to the analysis, the logistic regression has a greater likelihood of correctly predicting the diagnosis of breast cancer in the future than the other supervised learning algorithms.
